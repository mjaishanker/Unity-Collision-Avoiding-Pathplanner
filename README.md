# Unity-Collision-Avoiding-Pathplanner
Using collision avoidance algorithms on agents to avoid each other when using A* to complete their path

A Unity implemented project with another contributor to create a toolbox for users to try out TTC collision avoidance algorithms and the A* path planner algorithm. The collision avoidance algorithms serve as the local planner to avoid collisions, when agents get to close too obstacles or other agents. The A* algorithm serves as the global planner to get the agents to their goal locations.
An UI system was created to allow users to place obstacles and other agents to allow them to experiment with the tool box.
The backend programming was written in C# using an OOP design
